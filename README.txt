This is where you explain your project


A suggestion about time admin:

1 project per week
day 1: get the data (download/create, etc)
day 2: preprocess the data to get ready training and testing data
day 3: create the model (until desired accuracy)
day 4: create the api to the model
day 5: deploy the model
day 6: get paid ;)
day 7: no work
